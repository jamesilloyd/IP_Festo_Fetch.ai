Test 3 (this happened ...)

- Worst possible scenario.

- Running a test with 1 SOEF, every single manufacturer using the marketplace and seeing how many messages are sent to each company every minute.


Test 3
- comparing the weights and seeing the effect
    -First try was seeing if variations in cheap and asap order had much affect (not much)

-now going to add in "FAST and EXPENSIVE" machines and just check that ASAP ordrs get matched with FAST machines 
    -50/50 split for the machine types
