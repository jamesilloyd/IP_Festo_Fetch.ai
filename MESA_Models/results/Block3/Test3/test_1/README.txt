This was just a dummy test to guage the whether we should explore the relationship between quantity and new order probabiltiy

Some interesting results so will run more indepth.

fixed_params = {'width': 60, 'height': 60,'splitSize':1,'distributed':True, 'proportion_of_weights':0.5}

variable_params = {'quantity':[6,20],'newOrderProbability': [8,80]}
